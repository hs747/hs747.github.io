## **About Me:**

I am a programmer with 4+ years of experience in the Roblox ecosystem, familiar with Fusion and Roact and am able to work in a Rojo-Git development workflow.
When working on projects, what I enjoy the most is problem solving and providing an enjoyable game to a community that will play it.

## **Familiarities**

 - Back & front end development on Roblox projects
 - UI development
 - Weapon Systems
 - Vehicles
 In addition to this, I have some experience using external tooling such as webservers to enhance control over a game such as for trading tracking in a simulator.
 

## **Examples of Work**

 
 - [Prototype Flying Car with Gliding Physics](https://www.roblox.com/games/7017964712/Wafflechad-Flying-Car-Submission)
 -- [Github Repo](https://github.com/hs747/FlyingCarRblx)
 -- A project I created for a game jam. The car uses an unrealistic, albeit based in physics, airfoil model to simulate the gliding. It also has suspension that is scripted entirely without any Roblox constraints.

 - [Visual Debug Library](https://github.com/hs747/EndlessSummerLibs/tree/main/Libs/VisualDebug)
 -- I created this after having a need for to visualize debugging such as CFrames or Vectors in the viewport. There are options for rendering on a per-frame basis.
 - [Melee Demo](https://www.roblox.com/games/4921483650/Lollipop-Bonk)
 -- Uses an underlying melee weapon system I made that has a custom hit detection implementation. I have exported this system into other projects aswell.
 - [A Minesweeper clone I made in a couple of hours](https://www.roblox.com/games/9641048721/Minesweeper)
 - [Top Down Pirate Cartoon Game](https://streamable.com/xrsano)
 - [NPC and Quest Dialogue](https://streamable.com/rxi8wt)
 - [Animal Caretaking Minigame](https://streamable.com/de7yra)
 - [Cartoon UI Design And Animations](https://streamable.com/vo7rlh)
